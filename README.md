# TRAFFIC-FLOW-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Severe traffic jams impact time and cost. Predicting traffic flow with weather considerations can help. ML models used: Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge Regression, and LSTM. Random Forest shows the best performance with the lowest errors, while LSTM follows closely with strong accuracy.
